# Cocktail-Curator-3.0

Welcome to the Cocktail Curator! We've created a page to offer recommendations based on the temperature of the city you're searching, as well as the option to search by ingredient and name to see all the possible choices out there! There is also an option to save those drinks to a list associated to your account for you to refer to later for when the opportunity arises. We've also got new functionality added since the last iteration as well! The ability to see the most viewed drinks, ranking and the ability to upload your own drinks.

Here is our deployed site on heroku! https://cocktail-curator-3.herokuapp.com/



Here is an example of the weather option in action. It takes the temperature in the given city and offers you a recommendation too match.
